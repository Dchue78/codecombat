# codecombat
This section contains my solutions for CodeCombat for Python.

I started playing CodeCombat in early 2017 to drive myself to get used to thinking in code.

I started this section in the hopes that it would help someone else having trouble with the game:

I have had my fair share of issues wrapping my head around certain codes and certain stages) and I have been on the receiving end of help from other players sharing their solutions on github. This really helped me to progress through the hard stages and have helped to give a form of structure to how my code should flow. I hope that in setting up my own, I can help others too.
